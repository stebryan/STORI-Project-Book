  "body": " What is Chemistry?  So, what exactly is chemistry? Chemistry is one branch of the physical sciences. Let's take a step back for a second to think about what science is. Science is an orderly way of thinking about and understanding the world around us. In science, we observe what happens and try to understand why it happens.  As we said earlier, chemistry is just one branch of the physical sciences, but it is central to our understanding of biology, geology, materials science, medicine, and branches of engineering, among other areas of science. Specifically, chemistry attempts to understand the world based on the behavior of the particles that make up matter: atoms, molecules, and ions. Chemists study the composition, structure, and properties of matter, as well as changes that occur in matter. Chemists make observations about the world around us and pose questions to learn more about those observations.   "

  "title": "The Scientific Method",
  "body": " The Scientific Method  The scientific method is a systematic approach to research that starts with making an observation and a little bit of curiosity. Usually this curiosity leads to a research question to try and answer. A hypothesis , is a tentative explanation or prediction based on our observations. The hypothesis is tested by conducting experiments. The results of these experiments can either validate, which is to support, or invalidate, which is to refute the initial prediction. If the results invalidate the hypothesis, then we can discard or modify it and try again. Many times experiments invalidate only parts of the hypothesis or theory, in which case the idea is modified. This is science at work!   If the results validate the hypothesis, they support the idea, but this does not mean the idea will always hold. All of the results, good or bad, contribute to our body of knowledge in a particular subject and eventually can lead to laws and theories. More on this in a bit. As knowledge, technology, and instrumentation develop over time, more experiments may be possible that lead us to re-evaluate current understandings. Let's apply the scientific method to a simple problem that might occur in our daily lives in the next section.  "

  "title": "Examples of the Scientific Method",
  "body": " Examples of the Scientific Method   A Practical Example of the Scientific Method  This is a practical example of an observation\/problem that needs solving.    Observe:  My cell phone battery is not charging.    Question:  Is my cell phone not charging because there is no power to the outlet being used?    Hypothesize:  My phone will charge if I plug it into a different outlet.    Experiment:  To test the predictions, plug the phone into a different outlet and see if it charges.    Result:  I find the phone does not charge when I plug it into a different outlet. The question and hypothesis must be modified, followed by a new prediction and a new experiment.    New Hypothesis:  Plug the phone into the outlet using a different charging cable and see if it charges.    New Result:  My phone will charge. The result supports the prediction and gives evidence our hypothesis is correct.    This is just a simple practical example of using this method to solve problems - but let's look at a scientific example next.    A Chemical Example of the Scientific Method  This example is one from history from Antoine Lavoisier, a French chemist.    Observe:  He observed combustion, or burning, in a closed container and saw there was no change in the mass of the container after combustion.    Question:  Why is there no change in the mass of a container containing a combustion reaction despite the fact that it appears there is less substance present after burning?    Hypothesize:  He predicted that combustion involves the combination of a substance and air, or at least a component of air, and that this component accounted for the extra mass that he could not see with his eye.    Experiment:  To test the prediction, Lavoiser conducted combustion experiements under various conditions with and without oxygen present.    Result:  Over the course of many experiments he showed that oxygen was essential for combustion.    Law:  These results led to his development of the law of conservation of mass. This law states that in a chemical reaction, matter is not created or destroyed.    To further explain laws and observations, theories can be proposed. In this particular case, John Dalton's atomic theory helped to explain the law of conservation of mass and Lavoisier's, and others, observations. We will talk more about the law of conservation of mass and atomic theory later, but for now let's take a closer look at laws vs theories.   "

  "title": "Theory vs. Law",
  "body": " Theory vs. Law  A law is a concise verbal or mathematical statement of a behavior or relation that always seems to be the same under the same conditions. A theory is a well-tested, unifying principle that explains a body of facts and the laws based on them. Essentially a law is the \"what\" and a theory is the \"why\". A few examples of laws include: Charles' Law, which is the relationship between temperature and pressure in gasses and the Law of Gravity. A few examples of theories include: Einstein's Theory of Relativity, Valence Bond Theory, and Kinetic Molecular Theory. Let's compare a few laws and theories to help better understand the difference between the two.   Theory vs. Law         A specific occurrence or  small number of occurrences    A generalization of  many occurrences     What Happened?  Observation  Law    Why this Happened?  Hypothesis  Theory      An Example - Gravitation  Let's think about something you've most likely heard of: gravity! Newton's law of universal gravitation states that any two objects or particles exert gravitational force on each other. This force is defined by the mathematical statement that relates the force experienced by each object to the masses of the objects,the distance between them, and the gravitational constant. Don't worry, you aren't responsible for knowing this equation. This law is an observation, or the \"what\" that is happening.     Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation   Any two objects exert a gravitational force on one another.        A diagram illustrating the gravitational attraction between two masses.   On the other hand, Einstein's general theory of relativity takes things a step further and answers the \"why\" something is happening. This theory clarifies the law of gravitation and provides an explanation for Newton's observations. Specifically, that gravity is a property of space and time, and the curvature of space-time affects the motion of objects. This is a brief, simplified explanation; a more in-depth look at these concepts can be found in a physics course.     General Theory of Relativity   Describes gravity using the curvature of space-time.       A diagram illustrating the distortion of space-time around a mass.     An Example from Chemistry  Now let's look at a chemistry example.The law of conservation of mass states that the total mass of substances before and after a chemical reaction remains the same. This is the \"what\" that Lavoisier observed in his combustion experiments. This law, the law of definite proportions, and the law of multiple proportions all led to the development of atomic theory, which states that all matter is made of small particles called atoms. This theory helped explain the \"why\" behind Lavoisier's and others' observations.     Law of Conservation of Mass   All matter is made of small particles called attoms.    Atomic Theory   The total mass of substances before and after a chemical reaction remains the same.       A diagram illustrating the conservation of mass in a reaction.    "

Experiments are very controlled procedures that are designed to collect data and observations that will support or nullify our hypothesis. Commonly, an experimenter will have a control group and an experimental group for testing. The control group is the experiment or trial that is fixed and used for comparison, while the experimental group will differ from the control groups by a specific influencing factor. It is also common to repeat experiments multiple times in order to ensure reproducible results.    Experiment:  Recreation of an event or occurrence to test a hypothesis.

  "body": " Variables   The influencing factor in an experiment is called the independent variable . This is the variable, element or factor, that is altered on purpose by the researcher. In an experiment we only want one independent variable so conclusions about the results can be made. If too many variables are changing simultaneously, it is difficult to pinpoint what caused the results. For example, remember the cell phone battery dilemma earlier in this chapter. If I had changed both the charging cable and the outlet at the same time, how would I know for certain which caused the battery to finally charge? The dependent variable is the variable that changes in response to the independent variable. This is what is recorded as the results, or data, of the experiment. The controlled variable or variables are the variable or variables that remained unchanged during the course of an experiment. There is usually more than one controlled variable. This is different from a control group. Let's take a look at an example.   Examples of variables in an Experiment  First, we need a question to answer!  Will a cube of sugar dissolve faster in hot water?    Sugar cubes stacked on one another.  Sugar cubes for the experiment.   Let's plan an experiment. We will need to record the time it takes a sugar cube to dissolve in different temperatures of water. So what variable are we, the researchers, changing? Maybe you thought of water temperature? Yes, we are changing the temperature of water so this is our independent variable.  How about our dependent variable? Did you say the dissolving time? We are interested in how fast the sugar dissolves which will be affected by the temperature, time to dissolve is our dependent variable.  Our control variables are everything else that is remaining unchanged during the experiment. Experiments will usually have more than one controlled variable, so be sure to be thoughtful and thorough when planning your experiments. What might be some controlled variables for this example? For this example, the size and shape of the sugar cube, amount of water used, and agitation are just a few possible controlled variables.    Variables for our planned experiment.    "

If a friend asks you to run a 5k with them, you know how far you're going to have to run because we all know what a kilometer is, or at least you can measure one, because it is an agreed-upon standard. A property that can be measured is called a physical quantity and every physical quantity must have a number and a unit. In this example, 61.2 is the number part, and kilograms is the unit part.    61.2 kilograms   An experiment involves detailed, systematic and connected steps.In this example, 61.2 is the number part, and kilograms is the unit part.

  "body": " Standardized Units  Units tell us the standard to which we are comparing our measurement. Without a unit, a measurement is meaningless. For instance, when a friend living in Europe tells me that it was 35 degrees yesterday, I might assume that it was very cold because I'm thinking in degrees Fahrenheit. However, it was actually a hot summer day because she was measuring temperature in degrees Celsius. 35 degrees Fahrenheit and 35 degrees Celsius are very different temperatures. As you might imagine, we all need to agree to a standard to communicate more effectively. That's why in 1960 the General Conference of Weights and Measurements adopted a particular set of metric units from which all other units can be derived: the Systeme International.  You may already be familiar with either the English unit system or the metric unit system, or possibly both. In this course, we will use the SI system, which is very similar to the metric system and has been agreed upon by the scientific community. While they agreed upon more than is given here, the physical quantities listed in this table are the ones we will use in this course.   SI Base Quantities and Units       Base Unit (Symbol)    Length  meter (m)    Mass  kilogram (kg)    Time  second (s)    Temperature  kelvin (K)    Electric current  ampere (A)    Amount of substance  mole (mol)    Luminous intensity  candela (cd)     The column on the left is the physical quantity and the column on the right is the corresponding base unit with the symbol of the base unit included in parentheses. Refer to the table above to see each pairing together. The base unit for length is the meter. The base unit for mass is the kilogram. The base unit for time is a second. The base unit for temperature is the kelvin. And the base unit for the amount of a substance is the mole. Notice that kilogram, the base unit for mass, is the only base unit that includes a prefix, kilo. You may also notice other physical quantities like area, volume, and density are not included in this list. That is because they are derived units and we will cover those later.   SI System - Système International  Agreed upon by scientists and utilizes the metric system with standards    All units in the SI system are related to the standard unit by a power of 10.    The power of 10 is indicated by a prefix.    It is usually best to measure a property in a unit close to the size of the property.     "

  "body": " Common Prefixes in the SI System  Now that we have our base units we can talk about bigger and smaller units. All units in the SI system are related to the base unit by a power of 10.The power of 10 is indicated by a prefix that is added before the unit.For example, using this system, we can recognize that there are 1000 millimeters in a meter, where milli is the prefix meaning 1000. Similarly, you could also say that there is 0.001, or one thousandth of a meter in a millimeter.  The interactive chart at the bottom of this page containing metric prefixes is very important. You will need to learn these to be successful in this course, although we do not use hecto and deca very often, it may be easier to learn them all using the mnemonic device: My King Hates Dragons Because Dragons Can't Make Money Now. This represents Mega, Kilo, Hecto, Deca, Base, Deci, Centi, Milli, Micro, and Nano. You should be able to recognize the symbol for each of these prefixes AND be able to convert from the base unit to each of these prefixes.  When taking a measurement, it is best to use a unit that is close in size to the item you are measuring. For example, if you want to measure the thickness of paper, it makes a lot more sense to report it as 100 micrometers rather than 0.0001 meters. This chart shows the prefixes and their meanings, including both the power of 10 and the full number.Note in the middle is the Base, which is ten to the power of 0, and equals one.For every step in either direction, you will do a calculation of the base times ten to the power.To the left of the base, 10 is raised to a positive exponent - these are larger numbers.To the right of the base, 10 is raised to a negative exponent - these are smaller numbers.   Using the SI System  The symbol for kilo is lowercase k. One kilo unit equals the base unit times 10 to the 3rd power. The \"unit\" of the base could be any of the SI units such as gram, meter, second, or mole. For instance, 1 kilometer equals 10 to the third power, , or one thousand, meters. Compared to a meter, a kilometer is very long. It takes one thousand meters to make a kilometer. Let's also look at a very small prefix. The prefix nano uses the symbol lowercase n and one nano unit equals 10 to the negative 9 base units. You could also think of it this way, nano units equals one base unit. For example, nanoseconds equals one second, so compared to a second, a nanosecond is incredibly short.   Use the interactive chart below to explore how each prefix scales the base unit and to review the associated symbols, powers of ten, and decimal values.   "
