  <title>Theory vs. Law</title>

    <p> A <term>law</term> is a concise verbal or mathematical statement of a behavior or relation that always seems to be the same under the same conditions. A <term>theory</term> is a well-tested, unifying principle that explains a body of facts and the laws based on them. Essentially a law is the "what" and a theory is the "why". A few examples of laws include: Charles' Law, which is the relationship between temperature and pressure in gasses and the Law of Gravity. A few examples of theories include: Einstein's Theory of Relativity, Valence Bond Theory, and Kinetic Molecular Theory. Let's compare a few laws and theories to help better understand the difference between the two. </p>

            <title>An Example - Gravitation</title>
            <p> Let's think about something you've most likely heard of: gravity! Newton's law of universal gravitation states that any two objects or particles exert gravitational force on each other. This force is defined by the mathematical statement that relates the force experienced by each object to the masses of the objects,the distance between them, and the gravitational constant. Don't worry, you aren't responsible for knowing this equation. This law is an observation, or the <alert>"what"</alert> that is happening. </p>

                <p> On the other hand, Einstein's general theory of relativity takes things a step further and answers the <alert>"why"</alert> something is happening. This theory clarifies the law of gravitation and provides an explanation for Newton's observations. Specifically, that gravity is a property of space and time, and the curvature of space-time affects the motion of objects. This is a brief, simplified explanation; a more in-depth look at these concepts can be found in a physics course.</p>

            <title>An Example from Chemistry</title>
            <p> Now let's look at a chemistry example.The law of conservation of mass states that the total mass of substances before and after a chemical reaction remains the same. This is the <alert>"what"</alert> that Lavoisier observed in his combustion experiments. This law, the law of definite proportions, and the law of multiple proportions all led to the development of atomic theory, which states that all matter is made of small particles called atoms. This theory helped explain the <alert>"why"</alert> behind Lavoisier's and others' observations.</p>
