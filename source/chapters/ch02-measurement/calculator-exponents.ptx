    It is important to know how to find and use the exponent key on your calculator.
    Different calculators have different methods for turning exponential mode on and off.
    Many calculators use a double capital EE or sometimes a single capital E or the abbreviation EXP.
    Be sure you are familiar with the exponent key on your calculator before a quiz or exam.
    To be ready, you may want to search the instruction manual for your particular calculator.
    You can also ask your instructor for help, however NOT during a quiz or exam.

    Let's look at the following problem:
    <me>
      \frac{1.2\times10^5}{28\times10^{13}}
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    These keystrokes in this order should ensure you get the correct answer when using the exponent key on your calculator.
    Try them now.
    The arrows are used here to mean "then press" and are not representative of a button on your calculator.Press the 1 button on your calculator, then press the decimal point button, then press the 2 button....and so on.
  </p>
  <me>
    1\rightarrow.\rightarrow2\rightarrow\text{EE}\rightarrow5\rightarrow\div\rightarrow28\rightarrow\text{EE}\rightarrow13\rightarrow=
  </me>

  <p>
    The display on your calculater should be 4.2857143 E-10.
    This is the way calculators display scientific notation.
    In order to use the answer you have to interpret it.
    We will talk about how to round and where to round later.
    You should always write the scientific notation out as a power of ten and not use calculator notation.
    The final answer to this problem would then be <m>4.3\times10^{-10}</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you do not get the correct answer, then you are not using your exponent key correctly.
    Remember your exponent button may not be EE.
    It could also be EXP or something else.
