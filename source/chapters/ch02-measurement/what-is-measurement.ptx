    <title>What is a Measurement?</title>

    <p>
        So, what is a measurement? A <term>measurement</term> is a quantitative observation.Remember from chapter 1, that means an observation that involves a number and a unit.
        Measurements are meaningful because they are compared to an agreed-upon standard.
        If a friend asks you to run a 5k with them, you know how far you're going to have to run because we all know what a kilometer is, or at least you can measure one, because it is an agreed-upon standard.
        A property that can be measured is called a physical quantity and every physical quantity must have a number and a unit.
        In this example, 61.2 is the number part, and kilograms is the unit part.
