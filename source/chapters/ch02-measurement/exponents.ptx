    <title>Exponents in Scientific Notation</title>

    <introduction>
        What do the exponents in scientific notation actually mean? Can we do the reverse from the examples in the previous sections, and put scientific notation into standard notation?

        <p>
            Let's look closer at the exponent part of scientific notation using the following interactive.
            Notice how 10 to the 0 equals 1, since any number to the zeroth power equals 1.
            Zero is neither positive nor negative, so it has its own rule.However, a positive exponent means one times 10 "n" times, n being the number in the exponent.
            10 to the 1 means one times 10, which equals 10 in standard notation.
            10 to the 2 means one times 10 times another 10, or 100.
            10 to the 3 means one times 10 times another 10 times another 10, or 1000.0.

        <p>
            Negative exponents do the opposite of positive ones.
            Instead of multiplying by 10 over and over, you keep dividing by 10, which moves the decimal point to the left.
            <m>10^{-1}=0.1</m> because you divide 1 by 10 once, and <m>10^{-4}=0.0001</m> because you divide by 10 four times.
            Use the interactive to see how each additional negative power shrinks the number.
