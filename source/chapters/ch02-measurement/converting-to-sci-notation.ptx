    <title>Converting a Number to Scientific Noation</title>

    <p>
        Here are the steps to convert a number in standard notation to scientific notation.
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    When you are looking at a number in standard notation, first, find the decimal point.
                    In the case of the number 5983 kg, it comes after the 3.
                    Typically, you don't write the decimal on a whole number, but we've included it here to make it clear where the decimal would be.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                    Next we move the decimal point to obtain a number between 1 and 10.
                    You want only one digit to be to the left of the decimal point.
                    So let's move the decimal point to just after the five in our example.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                    Every time we move the decimal point, we change the power of 10 by one.
                    If we move the decimal point to the left the exponent is positive, and if we move the decimal to the right the exponent is negative.
                    The full statement in our example then becomes 5.983 times 10 to the third power.
                    We multiply that number by 10 to the nth power, where n is the same number of places you moved the decimal point.

            </li>
        </ol>
