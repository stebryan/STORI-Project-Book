    <title>Standardized Units</title>

    <p>
        Units tell us the standard to which we are comparing our measurement.
        Without a unit, a measurement is meaningless.
        For instance, when a friend living in Europe tells me that it was 35 degrees yesterday, I might assume that it was very cold because I'm thinking in degrees Fahrenheit.
        However, it was actually a hot summer day because she was measuring temperature in degrees Celsius.
        35 degrees Fahrenheit and 35 degrees Celsius are very different temperatures.
        As you might imagine, we all need to agree to a standard to communicate more effectively.
        That's why in 1960 the General Conference of Weights and Measurements adopted a particular set of metric units from which all other units can be derived: the Systeme International.

        You may already be familiar with either the English unit system or the metric unit system, or possibly both.
        In this course, we will use the SI system, which is very similar to the metric system and has been agreed upon by the scientific community.
        While they agreed upon more than is given here, the physical quantities listed in this table are the ones we will use in this course.

        The column on the left is the physical quantity and the column on the right is the corresponding base unit with the symbol of the base unit included in parentheses.
        Refer to the table above to see each pairing together.
        The base unit for length is the meter.
        The base unit for mass is the kilogram.
        The base unit for time is a second.
        The base unit for temperature is the kelvin.
        And the base unit for the amount of a substance is the mole.
        Notice that kilogram, the base unit for mass, is the only base unit that includes a prefix, kilo.
        You may also notice other physical quantities like area, volume, and density are not included in this list.
        That is because they are derived units and we will cover those later.

                    It is usually best to measure a property in a unit close to the size of the property.
