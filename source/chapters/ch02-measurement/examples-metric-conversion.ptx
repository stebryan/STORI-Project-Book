        <title>Decimeters to Meters</title>

        <p>
            Let's look at some examples using a meter stick.
            While this is not to scale, the second bar represents one meter.
            Each smaller bar represents one decimeter.
            If you wanted, you could just count and see that 10 decimeters, fit in a meter.

        <title>Interactive: Count the Decimeters in One Meter</title>

        </interactive>

        <p>
            Drag the slider in the interactive to count how many decimeters you are stacking along the meter stick.
            When the slider reaches 10, the graphic shows the entire meter filled, reinforcing that 10 decimeters equals 1 meter.
        </p>

        <p>
            But let's write out the equations.
            Therefore, one decimeter equals one tenth of a meter.
            Or you could say that one decimeter equals 1 times 10 to the negative 1 meter.
            You could also say that one meter equals 10 decimeters.
