        <title>Decimeters to Meters</title>

        <p>
            Let's look at some examples using a meter stick.
            While this is not to scale, the second bar represents one meter.
            Each smaller bar represents one decimeter.
            If you wanted, you could just count and see that 10 decimeters, fit in a meter.

    <subsection xml:id="example2">
        <title>Centimeters to Meters</title>

        <p>
            Let's keep using the same meter stick, but now focus on centimeters.
            The second bar is still one meter long—this time divided into 100 equal centimeter blocks.
            Just like before, you can count all the blocks to see that 100 centimeters fit exactly into one meter.

    <subsection xml:id="example3">
        <title>Millimeters to Meters</title>

        <p>
            Finally, zoom in even further by looking at millimeters on that same meter stick.
            This bar is broken into 1,000 millimeter slices.
            Slide through them to see that filling all 1,000 millimeters still lines up with one full meter.
