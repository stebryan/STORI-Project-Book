    <title>Significant Figures</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>
            When we made measurements in the previous sections, we recorded all known or certain digits plus one estimated or uncertain digit.
            These digits together are called <term>significant digits</term> or <term>significant figures</term>, sometimes shortened to sig figs.
            Significant figures are an estimation of the precision, or repeatability, of a measurement.
            Precision is like drawing within the lines, and when we talk about its repeatability it is like being able to consistently draw within the lines.
            Precision should not be confused with accuracy.
            Accuracy is how close a measurement is to the actual or true value, for example knowing the exact amount of flour in a cookie recipe.
            There is an objective fact in the middle of it, which is wrapped in a precise package.
            For example, if I were to measure an object three times and all of my measurements are close together, they would be considered precise, even if my measurement was inaccurate.
            This is because precision is about how I repeated the process three times and came to similar measurements each time.
            Accuracy is about how close I came to the correct answer.
            Ideally the two are working in concert and any given measurement is both precise and accurate.
            This may be confusing at first, so try to just keep one main thing in mind: significant figures include all certain digits, plus one uncertain digit - which indicate the precision of a measurement.
            There are six guidelines to follow which will help you determine the correct number of significant figures in a given value.

            </tabular>
        </table>

        <p>
            The first guideline is that any non-zero digit is significant.
            For example, in the measurement 38.15 grams, there are four significant figures because none of the digits are zero.
            Let's look at the example in the second row, 5.6 times ten to the negative 3 grams.
            When counting significant figures in a number written in scientific notation like this one, only count digits in the coefficient part.
            Remember from the section on scientific notation that the coefficient part is separate from the base and the exponent.
            The base and the exponent part do not contribute to the number of significant figures.
            Look at the other examples above to make sure you understand how significant figures are counted using guideline one.

        </table>

        <p>
            The next guideline is that interior zeros, which are zeros between two nonzero numbers, are significant.
            For example, the zero in 50.8 meters is significant because it is sandwiched between two nonzero numbers.
            Another example, 2001 meters has four significant figures because the zeros between the 2 and the 1 are important to that measurement.
            Same with the third example, <m>7.02\times10^{2}</m> meters.
            The zero after the seven and before the two is an interior zero.Finally look at <m>0.040405</m> meters.
            You might think that the zero directly to the right of the decimal point is significant, but it is not sandwiched between two non-zero numbers, therefore it is not significant.
            More on this type of zero in guideline five.

        </table>

        <p>
            The third guideline is that trailing zeros after a decimal point are significant.
            Trailing zeros are zeros to the right of a nonzero number.
            For instance, in the measurement 50.80 centimeters, the last zero is a trailing zero and because it falls after a decimal point it is significant.
            These zeroes are written for the sole purpose of communicating precision, to tell others the measurement was taken to that additional precision.
            Here are three more examples of where the trailing zeros after a decimal point add to the significant figures.

        </table>

        <p>
            Trailing zeros before an explicit decimal point are also significant.
            440 milliliters, as it is written here with a decimal point after the zero, has three significant figures.
            The only reason the decimal point is written is to let you know that that zero is significant.
            The second example is similar, twenty two hundred milliliters has four significant figures because there is a decimal point.

                </row>
            </tabular>
        </table>

        <p>
            This is the first guideline that points out when a zero is not significant.
            Leading zeros, which are zeros to the left of the first nonzero number, are not significant.
            Their purpose is as a placeholder.
            In the measurement 0.449 grams, the leading zero is not significant, so this measurement has three significant figures.
            If we were to write this number in scientific notation, the leading zero would not be included, and this would be <m>4.49\times10^{-1}</m>.
            In the second example both of the zeros are leading zeros and to the left of the first nonzero number.
            This makes them not significant.

            </tabular>
        </table>

        <p>
            The last guideline is that trailing zeros in the absence of a decimal point are not significant.
            For example 3500 kilograms written without a decimal point has only two significant figures.
            However, 44000.
            kilograms, has five significant figures.
            The difference is whether the decimal point is absent or present.
            When the decimal point is written, it makes those zeros significant.

        <p>
            There are some numbers that are considered to have an infinite number of significant figures.
            These are called exact numbers because they are known exactly and have no uncertainty.
            Some examples of these are definitions and counted numbers.
            There are exactly 12 objects in a dozen - this is an exact number and is said to have infinite sig figs, not just two.
            Metric prefix conversions are also exact, for example, there are exactly 1000 mL in a liter.
            If I count 24 students in a lab, this is also an exact number because there is no uncertainty.
            Inexact numbers are not known exactly and do have some uncertainty.
            Measurements are inexact numbers.
            We use the previous guidelines for significant figures to determine the number of significant figures in an inexact number.
