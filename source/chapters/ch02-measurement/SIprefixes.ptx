    <title>Common Prefixes in the SI System</title>

        Now that we have our base units we can talk about bigger and smaller units.
        All units in the SI system are related to the base unit by a power of 10.
        The power of 10 is indicated by a prefix that is added before the unit.For example, using this system, we can recognize that there are 1000 millimeters in a meter, where milli is the prefix meaning 1000.
        Similarly, you could also say that there is 0.001, or one thousandth of a meter in a millimeter.

        The interactive chart at the bottom of this page containing metric prefixes is very important.
        You will need to learn these to be successful in this course, although we do not use hecto and deca very often, it may be easier to learn them all using the mnemonic device: My King Hates Dragons Because Dragons Can't Make Money Now.
        This represents Mega, Kilo, Hecto, Deca, Base, Deci, Centi, Milli, Micro, and Nano.
        You should be able to recognize the symbol for each of these prefixes AND be able to convert from the base unit to each of these prefixes.

        When taking a measurement, it is best to use a unit that is close in size to the item you are measuring.
        For example, if you want to measure the thickness of paper, it makes a lot more sense to report it as 100 micrometers rather than 0.0001 meters.
        This chart shows the prefixes and their meanings, including both the power of 10 and the full number.
        Note in the middle is the Base, which is <m>10^0</m>, and equals one.For every step in either direction, you will do a calculation of the base times ten to the power.
        To the left of the base, 10 is raised to a positive exponent - these are larger numbers.
        To the right of the base, 10 is raised to a negative exponent - these are smaller numbers.

        <p>
            The symbol for kilo is lowercase k.
            One kilo unit equals the base unit times 10 to the 3rd power.
            The "unit" of the base could be any of the SI units such as gram, meter, second, or mole.
            For instance, 1 kilometer equals 10 to the third power, <m> 10^{3} </m>, or one thousand, meters.
            Compared to a meter, a kilometer is very long.
            It takes one thousand meters to make a kilometer.
            Let's also look at a very small prefix.
            The prefix nano uses the symbol lowercase n and one nano unit equals 10 to the negative 9 base units.
            You could also think of it this way, <m> 10^{9} </m> nano units equals one base unit.
            For example, <m>10^9</m> nanoseconds equals one second, so compared to a second, a nanosecond is incredibly short.
